    "Grouping by Similarity: It's all about finding inherent patterns in your data by grouping data points that are more similar to each other and separating those that are different.   \n",
    "Unsupervised Learning: It's a type of machine learning where you don't have labeled data or predefined categories. The algorithm learns the structure from the data itself.   \n",

    "Think of it like a flat surface: Imagine a piece of paper or a computer screen.\n",
    "Two coordinates: Each point in 2D space has two coordinates: an x-coordinate (horizontal position) and a y-coordinate (vertical position). We usually write this as (x, y).   \n",
    "Example: The point (3, 5) in 2D space means you move 3 units to the right along the x-axis and 5 units up along the y-axis.\n",
